## Prompt

```text
Create a professional-grade 3D brick editor in a single self-contained index.html using Three.js from CDN modules only (no build tools, no external assets beyond Three.js). Must implement: precise stud-grid + plate-layer snapping with true stud-to-tube support validation and collision detection; extensive part library (bricks, plates, tiles from 1x1 to 16x16, slopes, technic, minifig parts) with 20+ authentic brick-like colors; intuitive click-to-place and drag-from-palette ghost placement; rotate with Q/E and right-mouse drag; instant per-brick recolor; shift-drag multi-select box; copy/paste/delete; unlimited undo/redo; switchable baseplate sizes; save/load projects to localStorage with auto-generated thumbnail; JSON import/export; grid and angle snap toggles; smooth orbit camera for mouse and touch; realistic PBR materials, soft shadows, and stud clearcoat shine; subtle placement sound + haptic vibration; clean collapsible side panel; template gallery (car, castle, spaceship, robot, etc.); clear-scene action; polished micro-interactions including drop wobble and delete poof particles. Keep UX premium, visually magical, and addictive. Return only the final complete HTML code, fully runnable with no TODOs or placeholders.
